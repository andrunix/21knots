21 Knots

WHAT IS 21 KNOTS? ?!
--------------------
21 Knots was the air speed required by the Wright Brothers
to get their first airplane off the ground. That doesn't
really have anything to do with the salon this web site
was built for. However, the owner is a pilot and she 
came up with the name.

This code is a simple HTML/CSS/JQuery web site to support
the salon. 

I doubt it will be reused by anyone or if anyone will be
interested in contributing. However, pull requests are welcome.
